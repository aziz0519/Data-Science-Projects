              "'The 0Chain Consensus Protocol\\n\\nJonathan Katz1(cid:63), Thomas Austin2, Siva Dirisala3, and Saswata Basu3\\n\\n1 Dept. of Computer Science, University of Maryland.\\n\\n2 0Chain LLC and San Jose State University.\\n\\n3 0Chain LLC.\\n\\nAbstract. We describe the 0Chain blockchain ecosystem, including a\\nnew consensus protocol oﬀering fast ﬁnality. We provide proofs of security\\nfor the protocol, along with experiment results validating its eﬃciency\\nunder realistic network conditions.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nSince the advent of Bitcoin [Nak09], the blockchain has revolutionized the world\\nof cryptocurrencies and distributed computation. Ethereum [Woo14] further de-\\nveloped this promise by integrating Turing-complete smart contracts into the\\nblockchain for building distributed applications (dApps).\\n\\nDespite the promise of blockchain protocols, they have been held back by\\ntheir slow consensus times. For example, in Bitcoin a transaction is not con-\\nsidered ﬁnalized until it is six blocks deep in the chain, a process which takes\\nroughly one hour. Newer protocols have attempted to address this limitation by\\nintroducing consensus algorithms with faster ﬁnalization times.\\n\\nOne such protocol, Dﬁnity [HMW18], uses a randomness beacon (imple-\\nmented via a veriﬁable random function, or VRF) for ranking diﬀerent pro-\\nposed blocks. The designers also introduce the concept of notaries who sign the\\nhighest-ranked block in each round. The authors describe notarization as “opti-\\nmistic consensus”; in most rounds, only one block will be notarized, and in that\\ncase the unique notarized block will be ﬁnalized soon thereafter. Importantly,\\nonly notarized blocks will be accepted as part of a chain by miners; this prevents\\nboth selﬁsh mining [ES18] and the “nothing-at-stake” problem [Poe15].\\n\\n0Chain oﬀers a “fast, ﬂexible, free” platform for dApp development through\\na proof-of-stake consensus protocol that extends previous work in several ways.\\nFirst, the 0chain protocol assigns various parties in the system specialized roles:\\nat any given time, a subset of the clients (referred to as the “active set”) serve\\nas miners running the consensus protocol; in turn, a subset of the miners act\\nas generators proposing new transactions. Sharders store the blockchain history\\nand respond to queries about that history; and blobbers store data needed for\\ndApps. This design allows for more specialized machines to be used for each of\\nthese roles; by reducing the number of parties running the consensus protocol\\nat any point in time, it also reduces network latency thus improving ﬁnalization\\n\\n(cid:63) Work done as part of a consultancy agreement with 0Chain LLC.\\n\\n\\x0ctime. 0Chain also introduces a squared staking approach for Sybil resistance, by\\nwhich miners and sharders are probabilistically chosen based on the square of the\\nnumber of tokens they have staked; this design incentivizes miners and sharders\\nto stake coins using a single account, and thus risk greater penalties should they\\nfail to run the protocol correctly. Finally, the 0Chain consensus protocol makes\\nvery mild assumptions about the network latency. This, in particular, allows for\\nfaster ﬁnalization time because nodes do not need to wait until all messages in\\na given round have been delivered, but can instead progress shortly after they\\nreceive their messages.\\n\\nIn this document we describe the 0Chain ecosystem, focusing primarily on\\n\\nthe underlying consensus mechanism.\\n\\n2\\n\\n0Chain Entities\\n\\nThere are several roles within the 0Chain ecosystem. A client is anyone who pos-\\nsesses 0Chain tokens. At any point in time, some subset of the clients constitute\\nthe active set and we refer to those clients as miners. (The active set is updated\\non a regular basis, and the mechanism for doing so is detailed in Section 4.)\\nAll miners serve as notaries and also implement the randomness beacon. At any\\ngiven point in time, some subset of the miners also serve as generators that are\\nresponsible for extending the blockchain by proposing new transactions. By only\\nhaving a subset of the clients act as miners, and a subset of miners act as gener-\\nators, we reduce network traﬃc and decrease the time for messages to ﬂood the\\nnetwork.\\n\\nThe 0Chain ecosystem also includes sharders who are responsible for storing\\nolder blocks in the blockchain, and blobbers who store arbitrary data commit-\\nted to the blockchain; the set of active sharders is also updated regularly. This\\ndivision of responsibilities is one of the cornerstones of the 0Chain architecture.\\nAssigning speciﬁc tasks to speciﬁc entities allows for greater specialization of\\nmachines and load-balancing of diﬀerent tasks. For example, blobbers must be\\ngood at storing large amounts of data, but do not need the same computational\\npower a sharder needs. We discuss sharders and blobbers further in Section 5;\\nnote, however, that they are not directly relevant to the analysis of the consensus\\nprotocol itself.\\n\\n3 Mining Algorithm\\n\\n0Chain’s mining process follows in the footsteps of [HMW18] to rapidly produce\\nand ﬁnalize blocks. Within a given epoch (namely, a period of time during which\\nthe active set does not change), the blockchain is extended in a sequence of\\nrounds where in each round r the mining process works as follows:\\n\\n1. The (decentralized) randomness beacon produces a random value ξr. This is\\n\\ndone exactly as in [HMW18], so we omit further details.\\n\\n\\x0c2. The value ξr is used to determine which miners will be generators in the\\ncurrent round. Each miner is chosen to be a generator with the same prob-\\nability (i.e., independent of their stake). The random value is also used to\\ndetermine a ranking among the generators (as in [HMW18]).\\n3. Each generator extends its current chain of length r − 1 by adding a new\\nsigned block containing all pending transactions of which it is aware. Each\\ngenerator sends the updated chain (which includes its new block) to all other\\nminers.\\n\\n4. After waiting a ﬁxed amount of time (denoted BlockTime), each miner—\\nacting as a notary—considers all the valid, length-r chains it has received.\\n(A chain is valid if it consists of blocks chained back to the genesis block\\nin the usual way, where for i < r the ith block is notarized for round i.) It\\nthen ranks these chains by the generator of the rth block. For all highest-\\nranked chains with rth block Br, it sends a signed veriﬁcation ticket for Br\\n(and the corresponding chain) to all miners. Miners continue doing this until\\nthere is a notarized block for the current round. (A miner continues issuing\\nveriﬁcation tickets if new blocks with the same or higher priority arrive after\\nit has already issued a veriﬁcation ticket for another block, but before the\\nnext round has begun.)\\n\\n5. As in [HMW18], when there are suﬃciently many veriﬁcation tickets for a\\nblock, that block is considered notarized. We currently consider a block to\\nbe notarized only if it has been veriﬁed by a strict majority of miners, but\\nit is also possible to require a strict majority of the total stake of the active\\nset.\\nOnce a miner sees the ﬁrst notarized block for the current round, it sends\\nthe notarization (i.e., the collection of veriﬁcation tickets4 for that block) to\\nall miners; sends the notarized block5 to all sharders; and proceeds to the\\nnext round.\\n\\n6. Our notion of consensus is similar to the one used in Bitcoin. Speciﬁcally,\\nin round r each miner and sharder takes their current chain to be any\\nvalid, notarized chain of length r − 1 (ties can be broken arbitrarily). This\\nmeans there may be temporary disagreement, however we show that min-\\ners/sharders disagree on blocks at depth r−k with probability exponentially\\ndecreasing in k.\\n\\nWe now prove that the protocol above satisﬁes safety as long as the honest\\nminers are a strict majority of the active set, and liveness as long as there\\nis at least6 one honest generator. We assume that all messages are eventually\\ndelivered, but make no assumptions about how long such delivery takes.\\n\\n4 Note that the block itself need not be sent, since in normal operation all other miners\\nwill already have it. If another miner receives veriﬁcation tickets for a block it does\\nnot currently have, it can request that block from other miners.\\n\\n5 In fact, it sends only a hash of the notarized block to the sharders; each sharder can\\n\\nthen request any block it does not already have from a single miner.\\n\\n6 For the purposes of analyzing the protocol in the present section we assume at least\\none honest generator. In our full protocol, however, we include a mechanism to\\nupdate the set of generators if no new blocks are added after some speciﬁed time.\\n\\n\\x0cTheorem 1. For any r, every honest miner eventually enters round r.\\n\\nProof. An honest miner enters round r only once it has received a notarized block\\nfor round r − 1, which it then forwards to all other miners. So once one honest\\nminer enters round r, all other honest miners will eventually enter round r.\\nConsider now some honest miner in round r − 1. As just argued, all honest\\nminers eventually enter round r − 1, and so the value ξr from the randomness\\nbeacon is eventually generated and received by all honest miners. Since there\\nis at least one honest generator, there will be at least one block proposed for\\nround r − 1; moreover, that block will eventually reach all notaries and so at\\nleast one round-(r − 1) block will be notarized. The notarization is eventually\\nreceived by the honest miner, who then enters round r.\\n\\nWe say that a round r is normal, denoted Normalr, if only one block is\\never notarized for round r. Note that under our stated assumptions (when the\\nadversary can act arbitrarily) this means there is a round-r block Br such that\\neach honest miner has only issued a veriﬁcation ticket for Br in round r by\\nthe time they enter round r + 1. (This suﬃces since honest miners only issue\\nveriﬁcation tickets for blocks belonging to the current round.)\\nWe say round r is ﬁnalized if there is a round-r block Br such that the chain\\nof any honest miner in any round r(cid:48) ≥ r includes Br. In other words, there is\\npermanent agreement among all honest miners on the block at position r (though\\nthe honest miners may not be aware of the fact).\\n\\nLemma 1. If Normalr occurs then each of rounds 1, . . . , r is ﬁnalized.\\n\\nProof. Let Br be the unique block notarized in round r. The theorem follows\\nfrom the fact that the chains held by any honest miners at any round r(cid:48) ≥ r\\nmust include Br.\\n\\nConsider the time when the ﬁrst honest miner begins some round, and let\\npnormal denote the minimum probability, taken over the random value ξ produced\\nby the randomness beacon and the random latencies7 of the various links in the\\nnetwork, that the given round is normal (where the minimum is taken over\\nall possible conﬁgurations of the honest miners and all possible actions of the\\nattacker). We have:\\n\\nTheorem 2. Assume an honest miner is in round r. Then the probability that\\nround r − k is not ﬁnalized is at most (1 − pnormal)k.\\n\\nProof. Consider the honest miner at the beginning of round r who holds a chain\\nof length r − 1. Round r − k is ﬁnalized if any of the k rounds r − k, . . . , r − 1\\nis normal. This implies the theorem.\\n\\n7 For the purposes of the present discussion, we treat the distribution over the latency\\n\\nof each link in the network as being ﬁxed for the lifetime of the protocol.\\n\\n\\x0cOf course, the theorem is only interesting if pnormal > 0. But note that Normalr\\noccurs, at least, when (1) the generator with highest priority is honest and\\n(2) the message from that generator reaches each honest miner before that miner\\nsends out a veriﬁcation ticket for round r. In general, pnormal depends on the\\ndistributions over the latencies of the various links in the network, as well as\\non the value of BlockTime. Under certain conditioned, it may be possible to\\nrigorously bound pnormal; for example, this is possible if one is willing to assume\\nan absolute upper bound ∆ on the transmission times between all pairs of miners,\\nas long as BlockTime large enough relative to ∆. In other cases, bounds on pnormal\\nmay be obtained via simulation. We include in Appendix A some preliminary\\nexperimental results that can be used to bound pnormal.\\n\\n4 Choosing the Active Set\\n\\nThe active set is updated in a series of epochs. A new epoch is begun every\\npredetermined number of rounds, but initiation of a new epoch can also be\\ntriggered earlier by the current active set if some miners fall below an expected\\nlevel of service.\\n\\nIn order to be considered for membership in the next active set, a client\\nmust write a transaction to the blockchain staking some number of tokens that\\nthey hold. (Staking a token means locking it so it cannot be spent; staking also\\nallows punishment if the client staking a token later misbehaves. We refer to\\n[Aus18] for more details.) The staked tokens of any clients who are not selected\\nare immediately unstaked (i.e., become available for that client to spend again).\\nIf a client is selected for the active set, its staked tokens remain staked until it\\nleaves the active set in some future epoch.\\n\\nWe wish to incentivize clients to stake tokens under one identity rather\\nthan under many separate identities. Therefore, we set the probability of be-\\ning selected for the active set to be proportional to the square of a client’s\\nstaked tokens.8 So, for example, if Alice stakes 2 tokens and Bob stakes 1 token,\\nand if only one client is chosen, then the probability for Alice to be chosen is\\n22/(22 + 12) = 4/5 and the probability for Bob to be chosen is 1/5. (In contrast,\\nif probabilities were directly proportional to stake then the probability of Alice\\nbeing chosen would be 2/3 and the probability of Bob being chosen is 1/3.) Note\\nthat this encourages Alice to stake her tokens under one name; if she staked 1\\ntoken as Alice and another as Ann then the probability of either Alice or Ann\\nbeing chosen would be 2 ∗ 12/(12 + 12 + 12) = 2/3 < 4/5.\\n\\nThe process for choosing a new active set for the next epoch in some round\\n\\nr is as follows:\\n\\n1. The value ξr from the randomness beacon is used to select 10% of the cur-\\nrent miners to be removed from the active set.9 It is also possible to instead\\n\\n8 Any superlinear function could be used.\\n9 If there are not enough potential miners to replace the 10% of miners being removed,\\n\\nthe fraction of removed miners can be changed.\\n\\n\\x0cremove the 10% worst performers in the epoch. We remark that this latter\\napproach potentially allows an attacker to attempt to increase its representa-\\ntion in the active set by always trying to ensure that it is not in the bottom\\n10% of performers. Another way of looking at this, however, is that the\\nattacker is thereby incentivized to perform well (at least part of the time)!\\n2. Replacements for the clients who have been removed are selected from among\\nclients who have staked tokens to be selected for the next epoch. As discussed\\nabove, each client’s chance of being selected is proportional to the square of\\ntheir total staked tokens.\\n\\n3. The miners in the new active set have some number of rounds to sync up\\nwith the blockchain before they begin mining. The mechanism for doing so\\nwill be described in a subsequent document.\\n\\n5 Sharders and Blobbers\\n\\nSharders. Due to the rapid rate at which blocks are produced, it quickly be-\\ncomes infeasible for miners to store the entire blockchain. Instead, that role is\\noﬄoaded to another group of entities, called sharders. A given sharder does\\nnot store all blocks, either; instead, each sharder stores only a subset of the\\nblocks. The blocks that any given sharder is responsible for are determined by\\nthe sharder’s ID, using an approach similar to consistent hashing [KLL+97].\\nSpeciﬁcally, in order to determine which sharders are responsible for storing a\\ngiven block, a function of each sharder’s ID and the block hash is used to gener-\\nate a value; those values are used to rank all the active sharders, and the top n\\nsharders store that block. In the case of ties, additional sharders may store the\\nblock.\\n\\nSharders are chosen to be active the same way miners are chosen to be part\\nof the active set, and on the same schedule. However, in each epoch a smaller\\npercentage of sharders is replaced. Note that when a sharder becomes inactive,\\nthe only blocks that need to be reallocated are those that were stored by the\\nsharder who is leaving. When a sharder joins, they must determine which blocks\\nin the entire blockchain, starting at the genesis block, they are responsible for\\nholding. Sharders begin storing new blocks immediately, and have some number\\nof rounds to try to obtain older blocks for which they are responsible.\\n\\nClients who need to access an old block in the blockchain can request the\\nblock from one of the sharders responsible for holding it. A client might ask a\\nsharder for a given block before that sharder has stored it (e.g., in case that\\nsharder has only recently become active). In that case, the client can simply\\nrequest the block from another sharder responsible for that block.\\n\\nBlobbers. Blobbers provide storage for the 0Chain network. While they are\\nprimarily focused on facilitating decentralized applications (dApps), they are\\nnot limited to that role; if clients wish to use blobbers simply for distributed\\nstorage, they may do so.\\n\\nUnlike miners and sharders, blobbers are not selected as part of the rotating\\nactive set. Instead, blobbers are assigned to handle a speciﬁc client’s storage at\\n\\n\\x0cthe time that client ﬁrst locks up tokens to acquire the right to storage resources.\\nAt that time, blobbers are selected by the mining network from the pool of\\navailable blobbers based on the needs of the 0Chain client. For instance, a 0Chain\\nclient might have business in London and San Jose, and hence blobbers located\\nin those geographic regions would be preferable.\\n\\nThe 0Chain storage-protocol document [AMDB18] discusses blobbers in depth.\\n\\n6 Advantages of 0Chain Consensus\\n\\nOur protocol and its implementation incorporate several features that result in\\nfast time to ﬁnality.\\n\\nFaster network-traversal time. The time required for transaction propaga-\\ntion, block generation, veriﬁcation, notarization, and ﬁnalization all scale linearly\\nin BlockTime, which in turn is related to the network latency. Thus, decreasing\\nthe network latency directly impacts the time to ﬁnalization.\\n\\nWe keep the active set small, which lowers the latency required for messages\\nto be propagated to all members of the active set. Note also that we do not\\nrequire clients who are not currently part of the active set to receive messages\\nsent as part of the consensus protocol during a given epoch; instead, clients will\\nobtain a copy of the current head of the chain upon joining the active set.\\n\\nAlthough we have a small active set, attacking the consensus protocol can\\nbe made to require an adversary to control both a majority of the active set as\\nwell as a majority of the stake that was staked by the members of the active\\nset. By setting the mining reward suﬃciently high, we can ensure that miners\\nneed to stake a large number of tokens in order to have a reasonable chance\\nof controlling half the stake in the active set—something that would impose an\\nunreasonably high cost on an attacker. Our squared staking approach also helps\\ndeter an attacker from being able to control more than half the stake in the\\nactive set.\\n\\nWe apply additional optimizations to reduce the network traﬃc, since this\\nwill also result in lower latency. For example, miners do not send full notarized\\nblocks to the sharders; instead, they only send hashes of notarized blocks to the\\nsharders, and the sharders then request any blocks they do not already have\\nfrom a single miner.\\n\\nFaster ﬁnalization. In executing the protocol we can dynamically adjust Block-\\nTime based on the observed network latency in order to minimize the time to\\nﬁnalize blocks. In particular, we suggest to set BlockTime equal to the median\\n(observed) network latency. In Appendix A we report on some experiments that\\nillustrate the eﬀect of setting BlockTime in this way.\\n\\nBecause we have a small active set, under honest operation the probability\\n\\nof having more than one ﬁnalized block in a given round is low.\\n\\n\\x0cReferences\\n\\n[AMDB18] Thomas H.

The miners are spread across\\n14 diﬀerent data centers around the world (California, Canada, Frankfurt, Ire-\\nland, London, Mumbai, Ohio, Oregon, Paris, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo\\nand Virginia). Although our simulations do not incorporate adversarial behav-\\nior, they do give a sense of how the protocol behaves under realistic network\\nconditions. Our experiments provide empirical evidence regarding how ﬁnality\\ntime is related to the underlying parameters.\\n\\nIn our experiments, we found that the block-generation time and veriﬁcation\\ntimes are signiﬁcant and comparable to message-delivery times; we also found\\nthat message-delivery times are noticeably diﬀerent for short messages (e.g.,\\nVRF shares and veriﬁcation tickets) and large messages (e.g., blocks), with the\\nlatter taking up to 3× longer to arrive than the former.\\n\\nIn our experiments, we vary the block-proposal wait time, wait mode (static\\nvs. dynamic), and the ﬁnality wait time. The table below shows the time for\\nblock ﬁnality in steady-state, the start-to-ﬁnish time for block ﬁnality, and the\\npercentage of rounds in which only one block was notarized. (In our experiments\\nwe never observed 4 blocks being notarized in a round, and the percentage of\\nrounds in which 3 blocks were notarized never exceeded 0.03%.) In our experi-\\nments we set the ﬁnalization wait time to twice the network relay time, and set\\nthe ﬁnality lag to 3 blocks. Hence, the start-to-ﬁnish ﬁnality time is 3 times the\\nsteady-state block-ﬁnality time plus the ﬁnalization wait time.\\n\\n\\x0cNetwork BlockTime Wait mode Steady-state Start-to-ﬁnish % rounds,\\nrelay time\\n\\n1 notarization\\n\\n200\\n600\\n400\\n200\\n200\\n400\\n200\\n200\\n\\n200\\n200\\n400\\n800\\n200\\n400\\n800\\n1600\\n\\nstatic\\nstatic\\nstatic\\nstatic\\n\\ndynamic\\ndynamic\\ndynamic\\ndynamic\\n\\nﬁnality\\n1200 ± 140\\n1300 ± 160\\n1300 ± 140\\n1400 ± 120\\n1300 ± 150\\n1300 ± 150\\n1300 ± 140\\n1300 ± 200\\n\\nﬁnality\\n4500 ± 300\\n5300 ± 400\\n5000 ± 400\\n5000 ± 300\\n4600 ± 400\\n5000 ± 400\\n4600 ± 400\\n4700 ± 400\\n\\n95.1%\\n95.1%\\n95.3%\\n99.4%\\n95.4%\\n95.3%\\n95.9%\\n97.0%\\n\\nTable 1.
